                  <br><br>
                  Ash:

                  Chris:
                  <br>
                  Okay.
                  <br><br>
                  Kim:
                  <br>
                  Cool. could you tell us about the different people that you interact with in your work?
                  Amani:
                  Currently interacting with a different section in the company. For example, I interact with the marketing team that they are responsible for the online stores and take their opinion or take their, what they want to how the, the store looks like. So we can achieve as much as possible from the profits. Like I'm talking about marketing, strategies and changing that into our website. Also because I'm participating in building and maintaining the internal system for the company. Also I meet another parties like the data entry, for example, and how we can organize the data for the company, how to make the data entry easy for the employment of employees who works on data, because there's a huge number of data they are dealing with.
                  Kim:
                  Cool. Thanks for that.
                  Eddie:
                  Can you please tell us your interactions with other it professionals.
                  Amani:
                  With Other it professionals? I can say that I enter with a senior group development in my department dealing with software engineers who works in the internal assistant for the company dealing with the technical and support system technicians.
                  Mark:
                  What about your interactions with clients or investors Amani?
                  Amani:
                  At the moment as a company, I don't interact a lot with the clients and investors because we are building our own website for the company, but in my previous work, I was dealing with a lot of clients from different backgrounds and a lot of different needs. Sometimes I built websites for simple purposes, like simple portfolio for normal people or both. I participate in building a great website or huge website for marketing agency. So as a web developer, you meet a lot of people from different needs and different backgrounds.
                  Mark:
                  Awesome. Thanks so much,
                  Ash:
                  Brendan?
                  Brendan:
                  Oh is it me? Oh i'm sorry. Sorry. I got lost looking at the rest of the stuff. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? And could you give us a bit of a, an overview of those
                  Amani:
                  Most aspects that I spend time on? Actually it's two parts. The first aspect is designing the interface for client because this, what a client would see, this is the user would see and interact with. So we, I need to give the most attention for it. And I make it as friendly as possible for the clients and for the users. So it takes a lot of time and a lot of ideas to come up with the best designs. Then I spend the other parts of the time making functionalities that compatible with this design and makes it as a whole package who works for, like, for the benefit, the client and for the person who owns the website.
                  Brendan:
                  Do you find much clashing between yourself with some of the design elements in what you see as better? Do you, sorry yeah, do you find yourself clashing with the marketing team? For instance, if they have a great idea of how they want a page to appear.
                  Amani:
                  Yeah.
                  Brendan:
                  But that's not quite how it can be done or you think should be done.
                  Amani:
                  Yeah. And that's why you need to be quite honest about it and tell them that's your, you may, that will not be professionals. But if they insist you give them as much as possible from what they want and they will deal with it.
                  Brendan:
                  Thank you.
                  Ash:
                  Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?
                  Amani:
                  The most challenging part is the deadline. Whenever you have a project with a tight deadline, even if it's not tight, it will be the deadline, always a pressure. And that's where you need to plan your project and make priorities for what you need to do first. And what the most important thing you need to finish first and watch, which is, that is an important thing to present at the end before the deadline. So yeah, deadline is the most challenging part in each project.
                  Ash:
                  Awesome. Thank you.
                  Chris:
                  Um is there anything that when you started working in I.T, Is there anything that's come up that isn't how you expected it today or yeah. Anything that you wouldn't expect to be happening in I.T?
                  Amani:
                  Interacting with other people from other like they studied another path like engineers or doctors or whatever. Then I couldn't find a rapid in development in their fields. Like the engineers have been studying the same thing over and over again for years, but and, and it, the development of things that development of environments the development of techniques is so rapid is so fast. You need to be overcome to be on the top of things and know studying new things over in quiet and a lot of times yeah, that's what was so surprising for me. How fast is the development in this field? How fast and how there's a lot of things you need to know and to be on the top of it. Yeah.
                  Chris:
                  So you're saying when looking at other fields, maybe they're there maybe more stuck in their ways, or they're just, I.T Just grows or changes so fast.
                  Amani:
                  Like you, like, if you miss it for one year, if you take a break from work for one year or two years and come back field, he will see a lot of things have been added to the field, a lot of techniques, a lot of platform. And that's what that's lot more had been adopted from so many companies that is so so vivid right now. It's still fast, so fast.
                  Ash:
                  Excellent. Thank you.
                  Kim:
                  Cool. what is something that you enjoy the most about your work?
                  Amani:
                  It's, they find usually the final step when you deliver the project and it will go live. That's the most when you see your, all your efforts is going live and it's in good way and people enjoy it, that's really joyful part of the work. The, the second thing it's the concept of nothing impossible in this field is really real. Like when you have an idea in your mind and you find it challenging, you know, you can achieve it if you spend a lot of time on it. And if you change try different techniques, you will achieve what you want. Even it is complicated, but you can do it, nothing is impossible in this field.
                  Eddie:
                  And finally, can you share an example of the work that you do that best captures the essence of I.T?
                  Amani:
                  The essence of it in general, the, to make our life easier and more proficient, more accurate. And I can, we can see the, how that happened and how that was helpful in the last two years with the COVID things, when we are staying home and everything delivers to our home and how that I.T Was very beneficial for everyone around the world. Like in my company selling the books and browsing through books online. And with this this kind of number of books in this kind of categories it's so easy for the clients or easy for the how to just browse the books and that will be delivered to your home while staying at home. And the same time, this is also beneficial for the company as a lot of profits. So it is just makes our life easier and make us both have a lot, a lot of profit from that.
                  Eddie:
                  Thank you very much.
                  Brendan:
                  Amani, I've got another one for you. You told us what you liked most about your job. What would be the worst aspect of your job or thing that you find most difficult about it?
                  Amani:
                  What's to come, it's not difficult as is sometimes the time, as I said before, sometimes the timeline you have and the deadline, you have a very tight time, you don't have so much time to search for things to need, you need to do, and you have to do it as soon as possible. So you will not get the best result at the end. That's really like not feeling good about It.
                  Brendan:
                  You get a bit frustrated about it.
                  Amani:
                  Yeah.
                  Brendan:
                  Yeah. Cool. Thank you. Anyone else have any other questions I thought of? No, not excellent. All right, Amani, thank you very much for doing this for us this evening it is much appreciated. Thank you.
