## Group30

Hi everyone.

Please if you are working directly on some core piece of the website make a new branch before committing to the main/master branch. Make sure also to fetch and pull updated files when resuming work.

We will use teams for most of our communication and file sharing/storage so if you are looking for something or someone head over there.

Please let us know if you have any problems in team chat and we should be able to help out. :)
